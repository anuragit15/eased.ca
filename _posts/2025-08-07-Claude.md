**Claude** has just unlocked a powerful new capability: turning **interactive artifacts** into **fully shareable AI-enabled apps** — all without writing deployment scripts or managing API keys.

## 🚀 What’s New: Claude‑Powered Apps

- Build, host, and share **interactive AI experiences** directly within the Claude interface.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- When users engage with your app:
  - They authenticate using **their own Claude account**
  - Usage **counts against their subscription**, not yours
  - **No API key management or billing required** from the creator’s end:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Claude writes real, customizable code (e.g. using React), which you can view, fork, and modify.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 💡 Use Cases & Community Builds

Developers are already creating diverse apps as Claude artifacts:

- AI-driven **games with NPCs** that remember conversations  
- **Adaptive learning tools** that personalize tutoring  
- **Data-analysis apps** with CSV upload + natural‑language queries  
- **Writing assistants** for scripts, documentation, and more  
- **Agent workflows** pinging multiple Claude calls in sequence:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🏁 Getting Started

This new feature is available in **beta** to Free, Pro, and Max users.

### How to build your first app:
1. Open Claude and click on the **Artifacts** tab.
2. **Describe your idea** — Claude auto-generates working code.
3. Collaborate with Claude to **debug and enhance** the logic.
4. **Share a link** to your interactive artifact — instantly usable, no deployment.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- No external API calls supported yet  
- No persistent storage available  
- Currently limited to **text-based completion API**:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 🌐 Why It Matters

With this shift, Claude turns chat into **rapid prototyping and deployment tools**, letting creators build and share apps in seconds—without infrastructure worries.

Imagine:
- Creating a **flashcard app** that auto‑generates definitions  
- Building a **role‑playing game** with dynamic responses  
- Or launching a **data dashboard** where users prompt Claude to analyze CSVs

All via a chat interface, with full interactivity baked in.

## ✅ Takeaway

Claude Artifacts go from static generative outputs to **interactive, shareable AI applications** — enabling anyone to create tools, games, and workflows with minimal friction.
